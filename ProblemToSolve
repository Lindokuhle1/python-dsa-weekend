Python Data Structures & Algorithms

Focus: Lists, Strings, Functions, and a bit of recursion.

Task 1 – Simple Telemetry Processor

Imagine you receive battery telemetry readings as a list of numbers (voltages).

Implement a Python script that:

    Finds the maximum voltage.

    Finds the minimum voltage.

    Computes the average voltage.

    Prints all voltages above the average.

Task 2 – Reverse and Palindrome Checker

    Take a string input representing a battery ID, e.g., "BAT123".

    Write a function to reverse the string.

    Check if the string is a palindrome (ignore case).

Task 3 – Mini Stack with List

Implement a simple Stack class using Python’s list:

    push(item)

    pop()

    peek()

    is_empty()

    Test it with some telemetry events like ["charge", "discharge", "fault"].

Deliverable for GitHub:

Create a repo: python-dsa-weekend

Use a single file weekend_tasks.py or split by topic

Include a README.md explaining each task and how to run it
